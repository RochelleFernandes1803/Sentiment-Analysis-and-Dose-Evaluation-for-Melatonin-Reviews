# Sentiment-Analysis-and-Dose-Evaluation-for-Melatonin-Reviews
**Objective**:

Conducted sentiment analysis on customer reviews of melatonin products to understand customer opinions.
Evaluated the relationship between sentiment and different dosage levels.

**Data Preprocessing:**

Cleaned and processed raw review data, handling missing values and converting text data into a suitable format.
Utilized natural language processing (NLP) techniques to prepare the text data for analysis.

**Text Analysis:**

Employed TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert text data into numerical vectors.
Explored N-gram analysis to extract meaningful insights from the reviews.

**Machine Learning Models:**

Implemented machine learning classification models, including Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM), for sentiment analysis.
Trained and evaluated models on a labeled dataset, assessing accuracy and performance.

**Dose Evaluation:**

Analyzed the impact of different dosage levels on customer sentiment.
Explored correlations between sentiment scores and specific dosage amounts.

**Resampling Techniques:**

Implemented resampling techniques, such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), to address imbalances in the dataset.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:**

Conducted hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize the performance of the Logistic Regression model.

**Visualization:**
Created visualizations, including confusion matrices and line plots, to effectively communicate the results of sentiment analysis and dose evaluation.
